## About the Small Coding Dojo

We are a group from different companies striving to become better software developers and architects. Aged from mid-twenty to mid-fifty our skill levels range from novice developer to consultants with decades of experience.

Every week we meet for a 90 minute coding dojo. We deliberately practice and develop our skills further by solving code katas and discussing design aspects as a mob team.

The overall purpose of the "small-coding-dojo" organization is to learn, to grow individually and to support other software developers and architects.

## Licenses Used in Our Projects

We select one license per project repository. Usually we use The Unlicense. When we fork a repository we comply with the license of the original project.

Note that we have made this agreement recently. We are currently creating LICENSE files in each repository. This will take some time, because we need to select the proper licenses.
